Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is an action-adventure stealth video game directed by Hideo Kojima.
Snake Eater was developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan and published by Konami for the PlayStation 2, and was released on November 17, 2004, in North America; December 16, 2004, in Japan; and in March 2005 in Europe and Australia.
The game, which serves as a prequel to the entire Metal Gear series, was followed by four direct sequels titled Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.
Set in the Cold War-era Soviet Union in 1964, the story centers on FOX operative Naked Snake as he attempts to rescue a weapons designer, sabotage an experimental superweapon, and assassinate his defected former boss.
While previous games were set in a primarily urban environment, Snake Eater adopts a 1960s Soviet jungle setting, with the high tech, near-future trappings of previous Metal Gear Solid games being replaced with the wilderness.
While the setting has changed, the game's focus remains on stealth and infiltration, while retaining the series' self-referential, fourth wall-breaking sense of humor.
The story of Snake Eater is told through numerous cut scenes and radio conversations.
Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater was critically acclaimed, and sold 3.6 million copies worldwide by August 2005.
