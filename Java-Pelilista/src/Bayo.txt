Bayonetta is a third-person action game for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii U, developed by PlatinumGames in cooperation with publisher Sega.
The game was originally released in Japan in October 2009, and in North America and Europe in January 2010 on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, with the Wii U version released on September 20, 2014, in Japan, followed by worldwide release on October 24, 2014.
The Wii U version contains exclusive, Nintendo-themed costumes and is bundled with every retail copy of the Wii U-exclusive Bayonetta 2, or it can be purchased separately in the Nintendo eShop (with a discounted price if bought alongside Bayonetta 2).
Bayonetta centers on its title character, the witch Bayonetta, who uses firearms and magical attacks to fight against angelic enemies. 
The game's developers designed its characters with modern style and fashion in mind, and it is composed with a largely upbeat soundtrack.
Reviews praised Bayonetta for its easily learned yet deep combat, fast pace, boss battles, time slowdown or "Witch Time" mechanic, and character and stage designs.
The game has sold 1.35 million units worldwide by March 31, 2010.
An anime film adaptation of the game by Gonzo, Bayonetta: Bloody Fate, was released in Japan in November 2013.
