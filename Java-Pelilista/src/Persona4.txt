Persona 4 Golden, released in Japan as Persona 4: The Golden, was announced in August 2011 as an enhanced remake of Persona 4 for the portable PlayStation Vita.
It was originally planned by Atlus to be a PlayStation Portable title, similar to Persona 3 Portable, which would have required removing some of the features of the PlayStation 2 game.
However, the Vita provided sufficient resources that allowed Atlus to expand the game.
It is an expanded version of the PlayStation 2 title, adding new features and story elements to the game.
A new character named Marie was added to the story.
Additional Personas, character outfits, and expanded spoken lines and anime cutscenes are included as well as two new Social Links for Marie and Tohru Adachi.
The game supports the wireless networking features of the Vita, allowing a player to call in help from other players to help in dungeon battles.
Another new feature is a garden that produces items the player can use in the various dungeons.
The game was released in Japan on June 14, 2012.
Persona 4: The Golden is also the first Persona game to be released in traditional Chinese.
